MyJournal Flask Blog<br>
 This project is from the python web development tech degree at TeamTreehouse.<br>
 This web application utilizes Flask microframework along with Peewee ORM to allow<br>
 registered users to add, edit and delete post on the website. Each added post is <br>
 displayed on the homepage with a link to view the entire post.

Prerequisites<br>
 Python 3.5+ Installation<br>
 (1) First, set up a virtualenv. There are multiple ways to do this and plenty<br>
 of tutorials online, so we won't cover it here.


(2) Next, clone to repo to get the code<br>

git clone https://github.com/BrandonOakes/Flask-Blog-App.git <br>
(3) Once that is done, from within the newly-cloned directory (Flask-Blog-App),<br>
install program requirements

pip install - requirements.txt <br>
(4) Next, run the Flask app<br>

python3 app.py<br>
(5) The app will be running locally on port 8000, so you can access it in your browser at<bt>

http://0.0.0.0:8000/ That's it! Feel free to play around with the app<br>
 - create an account and register some posts.
