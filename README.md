MyJournal Flask Blog
This project is from the python web development tech degree at TeamTreehouse. This web application utilizes Flask microframework along with Peewee ORM to allow registered users to add, edit and delete post on the website. Each added post is displayed on the homepage with a link to view the entire post.

Prerequisites
Python 3.5+
Installation
(1) First, set up a virtualenv. There are multiple ways to do this and plenty of tutorials online, so we won't cover it here.

(2) Next, clone to repo to get the code

git clone https://github.com/BrandonOakes/Flask-Blog-App.git
(3) Once that is done, from within the newly-cloned directory (Flask-Blog-App), install program requirements

pip install - requirements.txt
(4) Next, run the Flask app

python3 app.py
(5) The app will be running locally on port 8000, so you can access it in your browser at

http://0.0.0.0:8000/
That's it! Feel free to play around with the app - create an account and register some posts.
